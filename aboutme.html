								<h2>My Interests</h2>
								<p>I am a multifaceted individual with a diverse range of interests that span both creative and adventurous pursuits. My passion for traveling in Australia has allowed me to explore the rich and diverse landscapes of this beautiful continent, from the breathtaking outback to the stunning coastal regions. Alongside this, my love for live music draws me to local concerts and festivals, where I revel in the euphoria of live performances. Equally, I find solace in the tranquility of the beach and the serenity it offers, providing the perfect escape from the hustle and bustle of daily life. My adventurous spirit finds expression in outdoor activities, from hiking in the rugged Australian wilderness to camping under the starry skies. Furthermore, I enjoy channeling my creativity through woodworking and sewing. Crafting unique pieces and garments allows me to translate my imagination into tangible works of art. These varied interests enrich my life, fostering a sense of continuous learning, exploration, and self-expression.</p>

								<h2>Why Did I Choose Teaching?</h2>
								<p>During my HSC I completed a hospitality VET course in which I had an amazing and extremely supportive teacher. During this course I had the opportunity to obtain my certificate 3 in hospitality as well as my barrister certificate. Both of these certifications allowed me to gain employment in the hospitality sector upon finishing school. During my senior years the school provided opportunity for the hospitality students to open a completely student run cafe in which we could volunteer and serve staff and teachers. This along with the other opportunities that arose during the Hospitality course were without a doubt the highlight of my student career. This was a passion that I briefly visited when I was a child among the many other passions of the typical 4 year old but was not one that I had thought twice about. Being able to explore different avenues through TAS allowed me to realise my enjoyment in being immersed in the hospitality industry leading to my first cafe job after finishing school.This led me to want to become a hospitality teacher myself in which my teacher helped me through the enrolling process to be able to attend the same university that she did. 
									Another reason why I wanted to become a TAS teacher was due to my experience with special needs students which is another one of my passions which was brought about by my own siblings who have a range of special needs and with whom I have been heavily involved in their education and care outside of school. On top of this, mid way through year 11 I was diagnosed with inattentive ADHD and had been a below average student up until this point. From years 7 to 11 I struggled with subjects that weren't engaging or hands on but often topped subjects such as cooking, sewing and wood work. I recognise that a lot of the skills taught in TAS subjects are pivotal in helping a student gain independence outside of school as well as providing opportunities to explore and develop new passions. 
									I chose to become a TAS teacher as I enjoy the subject and want to be apart of the process that helps equip students with life skills and to help students similar to myself that excel in hand on activities to nurture and support potential passions. In this course I have chosen to major in the industrial scheme as I seemed to excel in this unit compared to my original direction in hospitality teaching. ​</p>
