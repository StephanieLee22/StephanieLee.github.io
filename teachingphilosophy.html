								<h2>My Teaching Philosophy and Aim</h2>
								<p>The kind of teacher I would like to be for students such as these is kind, patient and understanding of their struggles and how their behavior in most cases is something that requires support rather than criticism. I believe behind every misbehavior is a valid reason whether it be a disability, struggles outside of school or lack of support. My main aim or priority as a teacher is the reason I became a teacher. I aim to help students such as these reach their full, untapped potential and give them patience and support that they may not have received previously. I aim to be flexible and determined in finding teaching methods that work best for them. My overall approach to positive learner engagement and classroom management thus far is to create routine and consistency for students in the expected behavior and to praise good behavior when it occurs, I aim to set expectations and give students time to respond to these and do the right thing, I Approach positive learner engagement by ensuring students feel their knowledge and contribution is valued and important by praising their contributions and positive behavior. My approach is based on choice theory and the pragmatic method. As I place high value on my students' wellbeing I aim to engineer positive behavior and engagement through making sure firstly that my students' needs are met. </p>
