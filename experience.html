								<h1>My Experience</h1>
								<h2>Disability Support</h2>
								<p>I currently hold a position with the disability support company Mummymetime. I have worked with children from the ages of 4 moths old to 13 years old while working at Mummymetime and have also been partly assisting with my own sibling’s care from a young age. During my employment with Mummymetime I have worked with a wide range of children with special needs. During shifts I organize many activities with the children and often bring my own resources where permitted that are based upon the child's specific needs and what will be engaging and helpful to them. I ensure that all aspects of the child’s need are met as well as provide support to the primary caregivers if needed.</p>
								<h2>Swim Teaching</h2>
								<p>I was formerly employed by little fins swim school from 2020 to 2021 as a swim teacher in which I work with children aged from 2-11 years old. My roles included teaching basic through to advance skills and water safety as well as ensuring the students have an enjoyable lesson. Through this job I was able to demonstrate my patience, problem solving skills and creative thinking in order to cater to the customers preferences, so the student gets the most out of the lesson.</p>
								<h2>Work Experience</h2>
								<h3>Sylvanvale Aspect School</h3>
								<p>In 2018 I completed a week's work experience at the Autistic specific school in Kirrawee. This experience gave me the opportunity to work with a range of unique kids with ‘high functioning’ autism as well as those who were nonverbal and sensory. This opportunity enabled me to learn to approach each student sensitively and open mindedly in order to learn their preferences and learning capabilities so I could best assist them with their learning. This experience helped build my patience, creative thinking and problem-solving skills.</p>
								<h3>Cafe Kazu</h3>
								<p>As part of my senior hospitality course, I completed a week’s worth of work experience at Café Kazu in Miranda as a front of house worker. This experience helped me build my customer service and time management skills while providing opportunity to demonstrate my hard-working nature, attention to detail and initiative.</p>
								<h3>Cafe De Kirra</h3>
								<p>Whilst studying hospitality through years 11 and 12, I volunteered multiple mornings a week in my school’s local café in which I took orders, prepared and served coffee and ran orders as well as completing set up and closing. While working at the café I placed great value on quality assurance and completing tasks to the highest possible standard in a timely manner. I was also able to exercise my problem-solving skills, good work ethic and customer service skills which allowed me to build rapport with the teachers, students and other staff who visited.</p>
								<h3>Donald Robinson retirement village Christmas function</h3>
								<p>In 2019 I volunteered at the Donald Robinson retirement village to assist the running of their annual Christmas lunch. This highly rewarding experience provided opportunity to serve a unique group of customers, as well as to learn how to cater to and be sensitive to their special needs. My responsibilities included assisting in the preparation of entrees and desserts as well as serving food as part of a team in a cafeteria style service. Throughout this experience I was able to exercise my patience and sensitivity while building teamwork and problem-solving skills.</p>
								<h3>Donald Robinson catering function</h3>
								<p>In 2019, I volunteered to be a part of the annual Donald Robinson morning tea held by my school, in which I was selected to run the café during the function. My roles included delegating tasks to fellow workers and preparing and serving coffee as well as clearly communicating with wait staff to ensure orders reached their tables. This role enabled me to build my communication, problem solving and time management skills.</p>
								<h3>Preschool and garden maintenance</h3>
								<p>I have formerly held a position as a cleaner and gardener for the Grays Point Preschool from 2014 to 2020 in which I was responsible for cleaning the outdoor area and perimeter of the preschool as well as maintaining the gardens. I value completing this job to the highest possible standard in a timely manner to ensure the area is suitable for use.</p>
